# Artist Statement

## What your interactive artwork is?
This’s a "surprise" fabrication artwork. Participants activate the circles on the panel by clicking [5] on them to see the sounds[14] and colours of the circles. The sounds are allocated randomly but the same sound shares the same colour. The regular combination of four-pointed stars and circles also keeps the initial panel from getting too dull. When participants activate the circle, it will vary according to the amplitude of the sound. By controlling one diameter and rotation direction of the ellipse with amplitude [10], I realised the dynamic effect of irregular changes in the circle visually, which was more lovely and vivid. When the participant clicks the activated circle again, it can be back to a static state [6].

## How interaction enhances the viewer’s experience?
By comparing the monotonous static form with the flexible and lovely dynamic effect, the subtle sounds of life are lively and vivid here, which gives participants a kind of inspiration to pay attention to the details of life. At the same time, in terms of the choice of sounds, I collected some sounds with a sense of rhythm, which allows participants to create their own rhythm patterns while seeking "surprises".
